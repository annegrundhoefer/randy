                    <p>It may seem that the most frightening part of a drunk-driving charge is the possible jail time and monetary fine, but a <span class="lable3"> conviction would affect many areas of your life.</span> You would probably lose your license at least temporarily, making it harder to work and provide for yourself and your family. Sometimes convicted drunk drivers must forfeit their motor vehicles. You would also find it more difficult and more expensive to maintain auto insurance. Contact an experienced drunk-driving defense lawyer today to help avoid these consequences.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>If you have been stopped for, arrested for or charged with drunk driving, contact Law Offices of Randall B. Isenberg in Dallas, TX, as soon as possible to discuss your options and rights with an attorney who has experience handling drunk-driving cases. Drunk-driving law is complex and the guidance of a skilled and knowledgeable lawyer can make a significant difference in a defendant's experience and in the outcome of his or her case.</p>

                    <p>Domestic violence used to be viewed as a private matter between two individuals, usually a husband and wife. Given the prevalence of domestic violence and the effect it has on the lives of everyone involved, it is no longer seen as a private matter. All 50 states and the federal government have passed laws criminalizing domestic violence and offering civil relief to the victims. If you have questions about domestic violence, contact an experienced attorney at Law Offices of Randall B. Isenberg in Dallas, TX, for more information. Domestic violence charges are serious and <span class="lable2">should not be taken lightly.</span></p>
<br />
					<p>Most domestic violence charges can be charged as either a felony or a misdemeanor. A defendant charged with a felony can serve significant time in prison, whereas a defendant charged with a misdemeanor may serve only a short jail term or be required to pay a fine, attend counseling or be put on probation.</p>
